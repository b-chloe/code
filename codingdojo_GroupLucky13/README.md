# CacheMap
## codingdojo_GroupLucky13

### Website that tracks and organizes Cache Locations

#### Project Goals:
- Create a launched (AWS) website with the Flask framework, Python, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
- Allow registered users to share their location data and make an API call (for lat/long).
- Once location data is parsed, the location can be 'cached' and saved along with name, information, ect.
- Allow the user who created the cache to edit the location and name, information, ect.
- *possible* Show all cache locations as pins on a map.
- Allow comments on caches.
- *possible* Allow replies on comments.

#### Additional Notes:
- All pages have a MyCache, CacheMap, Add a Cache, Search Cache link
- Find a Cache and CacheMap could potentially be on the same page
- Clicking a Cache in the “Caches in {{loc}}” page opens Cache Comments
